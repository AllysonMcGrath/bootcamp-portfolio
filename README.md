# HTML/CSS-Portfolio Website

## Description

This is a project where we were given a mockup and required to create our own portfolio site based on the image and accompanying instructions. The main purpose was to demonstrate understanding of how to use HTML and CSS to structure a website. 

The first part of the project required using HTML to create the skeleton of the site. We needed to have a navigation that linked to three sections (About Me, My Work, and Contact Me). We then had to create those sections, with an image of ourselves, a paragraph of background, linked images to our work, and how to contact us.

The next part required adding CSS to add design aspects and positioning. This meant adding classes and ids to the HTML. This project required an understanding of flexbox in order to position elements on the page. We also had to add pseudoclasses to elements such as the "my work" images and the navigation buttons.

The last part was adding media queries to make the page responsive for different screen sizes.
